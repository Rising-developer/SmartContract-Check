# Errors

## Unused variable:
There's a private owner variable that's not used. It's redundant since you're using OpenZeppelin's Ownable, which already manages ownership.

## Visibility specifier missing:
The Tips array doesn't have a visibility specifier.

## Potential reentrancy vulnerability:
The withdrawTips function uses send, which is not recommended. It's better to use transfer or even better, the "pull over push" pattern.

## Lack of access control:
withdrawTips should be restricted to the owner.

# Key changes:

- Removed unused owner variable.
- Added private visibility to tips array.
- Changed withdrawTips to use call instead of send for better security.
- Added onlyOwner modifier to withdrawTips.
- Implemented a check for the success of the transfer in withdrawTips.
